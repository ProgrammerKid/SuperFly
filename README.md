2. Copy + Paste this line into the command line  
`git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerKid/SuperFly.git`
3. `cd` into the new directory, and `cd` again into the `app` directory.  
`cd Superfly; cd app`
4. Find your path
 1. In Mac  OS, Linux, BSD, or other UNIX like OS's:  
  `pwd`  

 2. In Windows  
  `echo %CD%`
5. Copy the `path`, from your terminal
6. Open a web browser
7. In the URL bar, paste the `path` to superfly
8. In the same URL bar, append `index.html` to the end of the URL
9. Hit enter. (Or go, or whatever)
