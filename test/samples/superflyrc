//something you probably didn't realize is that
//the rc is not just a js look alike
//it actually runs through the JS interpreter
//so you can make it do whatever the hell you want
//and i'm not even sure if you can access ajax shit
//though the rc... ill have to make a firewall for that

//note: don't make any custom variables, or functions outside of the namespace / object
